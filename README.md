# Chatbot - using Neural Networks
• Developed a simple deep learning chatbot application using python , nltk and tensorflow , which can chat via text-to-text.

• Created a standard feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers , which is trained to classify texts using a labelled dataset.

• The neural network then assigns a predefined tag or category to the input text based on its context and then an appropriate text response is chosen and displayed according to its tag.

• Technologies Used : Python NLTK Tensorflow Tflearn
